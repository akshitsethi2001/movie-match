# Project Report: Movie Recommendation System and Website

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The exponential growth of digital media has necessitated the development of a Movie Recommendation System to aid users in discovering personalized content. This project integrates data processing, natural language processing (NLP), visualization techniques, and a web application to enhance user interaction.

### 1.2 Objectives
The primary objectives include:
- Efficiently processing and cleaning movie data
- Generating content-based tags using the NLTK library
- Implementing a recommendation system based on cosine similarity
- Analyzing and visualizing data using Tableau
- Creating an interactive Streamlit web application for user-friendly exploration
- Integrating TMDB API for additional movie information and IMDb navigation

## 2. Data Processing

### 2.1 Data Collection
Movie data, including title, genre, release year, and user ratings, was collected from a reliable source.

### 2.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation
The raw data underwent cleaning processes to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize the format. Content-based tags were generated from movie descriptions.

## 3. Content-Based Tag Generation

### 3.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLTK was employed for tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal to preprocess movie descriptions and extract meaningful keywords.

### 3.2 Content-Based Tag Creation
Content-based tags were created to represent the essence of each movie, enhancing the recommendation system.

## 4. Recommendation System

### 4.1 Cosine Similarity
The recommendation system relies on cosine similarity to measure the likeness between content-based tags, providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences.

### 4.2 Implementation
The recommendation algorithm was implemented, offering users a top 5 movie list based on their preferences.

## 5. Data Analysis and Visualization

### 5.1 Tableau Analysis
Visualizations in Tableau revealed insights into genre distribution, user ratings, and trends over the years.

### 5.2 Dashboard Creation
An interactive Tableau dashboard was developed for dynamic data exploration.

## 6. Website Development

### 6.1 Streamlit Integration
A web application was built using Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for users.

### 6.2 Recommendation Display
The website displays the top 5 recommended movies, allowing users to navigate through and explore additional details.

## 7. Integration with TMDB API

### 7.1 TMDB API Usage
The website integrates with the TMDB API, offering users access to additional movie information.

### 7.2 Navigation to IMDb
Users can seamlessly transition to the original IMDb website through the TMDB API for in-depth exploration.

## 8. User Interface

### 8.1 Design Principles
The website adheres to user-centric design principles, providing a visually appealing and intuitive layout.

### 8.2 Responsiveness
The website is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## 9. User Guide

### 9.1 Usage Instructions
A comprehensive user guide is provided on the website, offering clear instructions on utilizing the recommendation system and exploring additional details using the TMDB API.

## 10. Conclusion

This project successfully integrates data processing, recommendation algorithms, visualization, and web development to create a comprehensive Movie Recommendation System. The combination of content-based tagging, cosine similarity, and API integration enhances user experience and engagement.

## 11. Future Work

Future enhancements may include collaborative filtering, user feedback loops, and expanding data sources for improved recommendations. Continuous updates to the movie database and advancements in NLP techniques could further enhance system accuracy.
